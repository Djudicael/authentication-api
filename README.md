# authentication-api

This application is a bullet proof microservice for authentication using nodejs.

The same project will be recreate in java golang etc. The architecture is inspired by deno.

The code is supposed to be extract for migration to a deno project without too much effort ( even if in reality ...) that why there is a deps.mjs strongly inspired by deno.

For now rethink db database has been choose but probably postgressql will be pick. 

because its still a nodejs project is not Typescript compatible. 
The choice was made to not have too much config dependencies.
